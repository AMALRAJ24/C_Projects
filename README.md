# C_Projects

Welcome to the **C_Projects** repository! This repo is a collection of C programming projects developed for learning, practice, and showcasing my skills in systems programming, algorithms, and basic software development using the C language.

## ðŸ“Œ Repository Purpose

This repository aims to:
- Serve as a portfolio for my  C programming projects.
- Provide learning material for beginners.
- Showcase solutions to common programming problems using C.



## ðŸš€ How to Run the Projects

To compile and run any project:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the repository folder:
   ```bash
    cd path/to/C_Projects
2. Compile the desired .c file using gcc:
    ```
    gcc project_name.c -o project_name
3. Run the compiled executable:
     ```
     ./project_name

      
ðŸš§ Coming Soon
  - File I/O examples
  - Sorting algorithms
  - Mini games (tic-tac-toe, number guessing)
  - Makefiles for easier compilation_
